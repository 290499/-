# YeezySneak
A bot to help me buy the extremely popular Adidas shoes

![myimage-alt-tag](http://i.giphy.com/Jylb9PZHvJZSg.gif)

Make sure and run 
```bash
npm i 
npm i -g gulp
``` 
To start the bot just fill out the options.js file and run:
```bash
gulp yeezy
```

If you plug the early link in with the countdown timer, the app will try ever .1 second to see if the countdown timer is still there and as soon as it disappears it will start the add to cart and checkout process. I'd highly recommend plugging the link in and firing this up a few minutes before release time ;).

*Also, I commented out the very final submit in the script so you won't actually buy whatever shoes you put in until you uncomment that line in the __index.js__ file.*

**Current supported sites:**
- [x] Eastbay
- [ ] Footlocker
- [ ] END
- [ ] Adidas


Good luck (¬‿¬)
